# For this project, I downloaded NBA data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert NBA data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE players(
   Player            TEXT,
   Team              TEXT,
   Conference        TEXT,
   Date              TEXT,
   Position          TEXT,
   Height            TEXT,
   Weight            INTEGER,
   Age               INTEGER,
   Draft_Year        INTEGER,
   Seasons_in_league INTEGER,
   Season            TEXT,
   Season_short      INTEGER,
   Predraft_Team     TEXT,
   Real_value        REAL,
   Height_CM         INTEGER,
   Weight_KG         INTEGER,
   Last_Season       INTEGER
);

#Then I inserted the NBA Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--What is the avg height of nba players drafted in the year 2014?
SELECT Draft_year,
AVG(Height) AS avg_height
FROM players
WHERE Draft_year = '2014';

--Make a height class to differentiate between the players heights
SELECT Player, Height_CM, CASE 
WHEN Height_CM >= 195 THEN 'Very Tall'
WHEN Height_CM >= 180 THEN 'Tall'
ELSE 'Short'
END AS Height_class
FROM players
LIMIT 10;

--What is the average weight of players in each conference?
SELECT Conference, AVG(Weight_KG) AS avg_weight
FROM players
WHERE Conference IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Conference;

--Which team has the highest average height of players?
SELECT Team, AVG(Height_CM) AS avg_height
FROM players
GROUP BY Team
ORDER BY AVG(Height_CM) DESC
LIMIT 1;

--What is the average number of seasons played for players in each position?
SELECT Position, AVG(Seasons_in_league) AS avg_seasons
FROM players
GROUP BY Position;
