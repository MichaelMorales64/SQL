# For this project, I downloaded NBA data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert NBA data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE players(
   Player            TEXT,
   Team              TEXT,
   Conference        TEXT,
   Date              TEXT,
   Position          TEXT,
   Height            TEXT,
   Weight            INTEGER,
   Age               INTEGER,
   Draft_Year        INTEGER,
   Seasons_in_league INTEGER,
   Season            TEXT,
   Season_short      INTEGER,
   Predraft_Team     TEXT,
   Real_value        REAL,
   Height_CM         INTEGER,
   Weight_KG         INTEGER,
   Last_Season       INTEGER
);

#Then I inserted the NBA Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--What is the minimum height of an nba player?
SELECT MIN(Height) AS min_height
FROM players;

--What is the avg height of nba players drafted in the year 2014?
SELECT Draft_year,
AVG(Height) AS avg_height
FROM players
WHERE Draft_year = '2014';

--Which teams had the most players drafted? 
SELECT Predraft_Team, COUNT(*)
FROM players
GROUP BY Predraft_Team
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 5;

--List the players who had more than 5 seasons in the league.
SELECT Player, Seasons_in_league
FROM players
GROUP BY Player
HAVING Seasons_in_league > 5
ORDER BY Seasons_in_league DESC
LIMIT 5;

--Make a height class to differentiate between the players heights.
SELECT Player, Height_CM, CASE 
WHEN Height_CM >= 195 THEN 'Very Tall'
WHEN Height_CM >= 180 THEN 'Tall'
ELSE 'Short'
END AS Height_class
FROM players
LIMIT 10;
